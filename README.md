## Features

* **Simplified Client Management:** Effortlessly add, edit, and manage WireGuard clients from a centralized dashboard on your MikroTik router.
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Gain real-time insights into VPN connections, including connected clients, data usage, and connection status.
* **Granular Access Control:** Easily grant or revoke VPN access for individual clients, ensuring optimal security.
* **Google SSO (Optional):** Enhance security and user experience with secure sign-in using Google's Single Sign-On system (optional).

## Requirements

* MikroTik router running RouterOS version 7.0 or later.
* Docker (version 19.03.0 or later) for running the MikroTik Warp server.

## Security

For transparency, MikroTik Warp interacts with your MikroTik router through the following PHP files:
|api/app/RouterOS/WireGuard.php
|api/app/RouterOS/IPAddress.php

These files contain the specific commands sent to the router. It's important to note that:

* No user input is ever directly passed to the router.
* Only pre-defined values you set as an administrator through environment variables are used.

We recommend reviewing these files if you'd like a deeper understanding of how MikroTik Warp interacts with your router. For more comprehensive security information, please refer to our separate security documentation.

## Setup

### Adding a User to MikroTik for MikroGuard

**Using Winbox:**

1. Log in to your MikroTik router using Winbox.
2. Navigate to the **System** menu and select **Users**.
3. Click on the **Groups** tab.
4. Click the **Add New** button to create a new user group.
5. Enter a name for the group, such as "MikroGuard-group," and click **OK**.
6. In the **Permissions** tab, select the desired permissions for the group. For MikroGuard, the user group should have **read, write, and API** access.
7. Click **Apply** to save the changes.
8. Click on the **Users** tab.
9. Enter the user's details, such as their name and password.

> **Warning:** Always enter the correct local subnet into the allowed address. If unsure about the configuration, seek expert advice.

10. In the **Groups** tab, select the "MikroGuard-group" group you just created.
11. Click **Apply** to save the changes.

**Using Command Line:**

To set up a new user group and user, input the following commands:

```sh
/user group add name=MikroGuard-group policy=local,read,write,test,api,winbox,password

# Replace "username" and "userpassword" with your desired credentials
/user add name=username group=MikroGuard-group password=userpassword

### Server Installation

**Prerequisites:**

1. Ensure Docker is up and running on your server.

**MikroGuard Deployment:**

1. **Generate an App Key:** You will need a secure app key for environment variables. We recommend using a dedicated password generator like [this generator](https://generate-random.org/password-generator). 

2. **Choose Deployment Method:** MikroGuard offers two deployment options:

    * **With Google Single Sign-On (SSO):** This option leverages Google SSO for user authentication.
    * **Without Google Single Sign-On:** This option uses traditional username and password authentication.

**Deployment Commands:**

The following commands demonstrate deploying MikroGuard with both options.  **Choose the appropriate set of commands based on your preferred authentication method.**

**With Google Single Sign-On:**

**Docker Command**
